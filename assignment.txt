Concepts You've Learned (Git & GitHub)
Briefly explain the Git & GitHub concepts you've learned so far (like repository basics, status, staging, commits, history, branching, merging, etc.).
• Git is like a notebook for your code – it keeps track of all changes.
• git status shows what’s changed and what’s ready to be saved.
• git add stages changes, like putting papers in a folder before filing.
• git commit records the changes permanently in Git’s history.
• git log shows the timeline of changes and who made them.
• Branches let you experiment without breaking the main code.
• Merging combines branches, carefully keeping the best parts.
• Debugging scenario: If an app breaks due to a wrong config, I can check git log to see who changed the file and when.
